My name is Ariel Fontes. I'm a Program Manager with a background in consulting and a strong focus on analytics, technology, and internal operations. I’m originally from São Paulo, Brazil.
I’m passionate about basketball, bonsai trees, and traveling. I enjoy fast-paced environments and projects that bring structure and clarity to complex problems. While I’m deeply involved in data and strategy, I still believe the best ideas often come over good conversation — ideally while eating sushi or something spicy.
